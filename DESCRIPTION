Description: Gene set analysis methods exist to combine SNP-level
        association p-values into gene sets, calculating a single
        association p-value for each gene set. This package implements
        two such methods that require only the calculated SNP p-values,
        the gene set(s) of interest, and a correlation matrix (if
        desired). One method (GLOSSI) requires independent SNPs and the
        other (VEGAS) can take into account correlation (LD) among the
        SNPs. Built-in plotting functions are available to help users
        visualize results.
